This project aims to develop a virtual assistant  The assistant will be capable of answering questions, performing tasks, and interacting with users through voice commands or a chat interface.

Features
Natural Language Interaction: Users can communicate with the assistant using voice commands or text.
Task Automation: The assistant can perform various tasks, such as fetching information, setting reminders, and managing system settings.
Personalization: Customizable responses based on user preferences.
Integration with External APIs: Incorporate external services (e.g., weather updates, news) for enhanced functionality.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and APIs:
Speech recognition (for voice input)
Text-to-speech conversion (for voice output)
Natural language processing (NLP) for understanding user intent
External APIs (e.g., Wikipedia, weather updates)
Architecture
